Install Pip3:
sudo apt install python3-pip

Install pip3 Ubuntu and Debian Linux
Ubuntu 18.04 has both Python 2 and Python 3 installed by default, and hence has two pip variants for each Python version. ‘pip’, refers to Python 2. pip3 refers to Python 3.
Ubuntu 20.4 has only Python 3, but still requires a separate python-pip 3 installation.
Procedure for installing pip3 on Ubuntu and Debian Linux:
Enter the following command to update Linux:

sudo apt update
Enter the following command to install pip3:

sudo apt install python3-pip
The above command will also install all pip3 dependencies.
To find the location where pip3 installs packages in Ubuntu Linux, enter:

which pip3 
Output should be similar to:

/usr/bin/pip3
4. Install TKINTER
naz@Snapdragon:~/code_haqathon/IrwinEarthens-main$ sudo apt install
 python3-tk

4. INSTALL QAI HUB:
 pip install "qai_hub_models[llama_v2_7b_chat_quantized]"

python -m qai_hub_models.models.llama_v2_7b_chat_quantized.demo

to set the memory, it is just like saying to your OS kernel, that use that space in your file system as an extra space for memeory
